# Deep Learning Challenge: Alphabet Soup Charity Fund Allocation
Background
The nonprofit foundation Alphabet Soup seeks a tool that can predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup. Given a dataset of organizations that have received funding in the past, the goal is to build a binary classification model that can predict the success of future applicants based on their characteristics.

The provided dataset contains more than 34,000 organizations and includes various metadata, such as:

EIN and NAME: Identification columns (to be dropped)
APPLICATION_TYPE: Type of Alphabet Soup application
AFFILIATION: Affiliated sector of industry
CLASSIFICATION: Government organization classification
USE_CASE: Purpose of the funding
ORGANIZATION: Type of organization
STATUS: Active status
INCOME_AMT: Income classification
SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS: Special considerations for application
ASK_AMT: Requested funding amount
IS_SUCCESSFUL: Outcome (target variable)
Steps Taken
1. Preprocess the Data
In this step, the raw dataset was cleaned and transformed:

Dropped unnecessary columns: EIN and NAME columns were removed, as they are identifiers, not useful for prediction.
Encoded categorical variables: Using one-hot encoding, categorical columns were converted into numeric features.
Managed rare categories: Columns with more than 10 unique values were analyzed, and rare categories were consolidated into a new category labeled "Other."
Data scaling: The features were scaled using StandardScaler to normalize the data.
2. Compile, Train, and Evaluate the Model
A neural network was built using TensorFlow and Keras:

The model had multiple layers, including input, hidden, and output layers with appropriate activation functions.
Compilation: The model used a binary cross-entropy loss function and an Adam optimizer.
Training: The model was trained using a batch size of 64 and 50 epochs.
Evaluation: The model was evaluated on the test data to determine accuracy and loss.
Saved model: The trained model was saved in the HDF5 format as AlphabetSoupCharity.h5.
3. Model Optimization
The model was optimized to achieve higher accuracy:

Tuning parameters: The model’s architecture was adjusted by adding more neurons, changing activation functions, and modifying training parameters.
Evaluated performance: After applying optimization techniques, the final model was saved as AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimization.h5 after reaching the desired performance.
4. Report
A detailed report was written summarizing the process and results of the analysis, including:

Analysis Overview: Purpose of building the model.
Results: Key questions answered with insights from the model.
Model performance: Steps taken to improve the model’s accuracy.
Recommendations: Suggestions for other approaches to solving the problem.
